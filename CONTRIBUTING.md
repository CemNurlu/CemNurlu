Hello! I know this game is probably REAAALY simple but, hey, who knows what creativity will bring?


   Since this project is not complex, i invite you all people who want to contribute to an open source project but can't seem to find one for you. Maybe we will make the project into something interesting.

#Possible Features that you can add:

-Better Documentation, comments on code to make it more clear,
-Difficulty selector,
-Changing hard coded stuff,
-Better bounce (i.e. bouncing to the side that ball touched),
-Randomly appearing boosters or such,
-Anything that your creativity brings.
